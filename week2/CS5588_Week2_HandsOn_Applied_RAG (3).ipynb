For example, a contrast agent protocol might state the indication in one sentence and the contraindication immediately after—fixed chunking could split these, causing the system to retrieve \"safe to use\" without \"except in renal impairment.\" Semantic chunking preserves these logical units, improving both precision (relevant chunks are complete) and trust (users see full context)."

For U1, trust is high because the top chunks directly answer the question with verifiable sources. For U3, trust is low because the system returned tangentially related content rather than admitting uncertainty—a clinician might be misled into thinking the system has a definitive answer when it doesn't.\n",
